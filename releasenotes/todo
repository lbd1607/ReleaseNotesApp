--Must Haves--
* Figure out how to display notes publicly, but none of the post/delete functionality
* Fix registration; clicking Register does not call any function
* Fix form visibility when refreshing as authenticated user
* Ensure published notes are landing page instead of login
* Create confirmation dialog for delete notes function
* Insert checks and messages to ensure usernames are not case sensitive

--Nice to haves--
* Format auto added datetimes as MM/dd/yyyy hh:mm
* Truncate note text into a preview and insert link to view all page
* Favicon
